# 🏹Text based game that is absolutely not pokemon👾
Text based mini fight game that is absolutely not similar to pokemon🦍. 
You are a fighter that scares (not kills of course) every enemy that you encounter!
You and enemy have HP, Attack Power, Attack and Critical Chance.   
  
A game that you encounter enemies that is not taken from pokemon and fight them by:  
-Attacking💥    
-Defending🛡  
-Healing💔  
-Running away🏃‍♀️💨  
  
Every turn you can choose any option from these 4, when you win a fight you will gain points. You and enemy will have an attack chance from a dice the game rolls for you, if you hit a big one you can crit too but your enemy can do the same so beware! Your enemy will attack you relentlessly but you can overcome them. Don't forget to heal a lot and have fun.
